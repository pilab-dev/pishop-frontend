 [33m[1mâš [22m[39m Support for Turbopack builds is experimental. [1mWe don't recommend deploying mission-critical applications to production.[22m

- [1mTurbopack currently always builds production source maps for the browser. This will include project source code if deployed to production.[22m
- It is expected that your bundle size might be different from `next build` with webpack. This will be improved as we work towards stability.
- This build is without disk caching; subsequent builds will become faster when disk caching becomes available.
- When comparing output to webpack builds, make sure to first clear the Next.js cache by deleting the `.next` directory.
